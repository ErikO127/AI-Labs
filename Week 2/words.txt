Introduction
Background information:
The term spectrochemical can be broken into two different words describing what it means,
spectro- which refers to the electromagnetic spectrum, and chemical which links to atomic
chemical properties. Ligands are a part of a unique area in chemistry explaining many
phenomenons when it comes to colors that we observe and have been used by humans for a
long time stretching back as far as ancient egyptians and are still in us in today's world.
Coordination compounds are atomic compounds that are formed when a special types of bonds
are formed between the central ion and the outer ligands. The central ion is always metallic and
the outer ion can be a variety of different common non metallic molecules or atomic ions which
in a complex compound are named Ligands. Some of the more common molecules that are
able to act as ligands in coordination complexes are water, chlorine atom ion and ammonia

The bonds that are formed in order to give a coordination compound its unique properties are
called coordinate bonds (or also referred to as dative bonds). Coordinate (dative) bonds are
similar and different to both covalent and ionic bonds in the properties of the bonds that are
formed. In a coordinate bond the lewis acid (outer molecule/atom) donates an electron pair to
the central ion (lewis base), however, not as in an ionic bond such that clear negative and
positive dipoles are formed, but partially. The coordinate bond does however create partial
dipoles hence the reason positively charging it, hence hence the reason the terms lewis acid
and lewis base exist (lewis base being the central ion).
One of these unique properties to coordinate bonds is d-orbital splitting, which happens due to
the bonds created in coordinate bonds splitting the electron orbitals into two different levels.
Normally a d-orbital consists of five different electron orbitals which lie on the same energy level,
these orbitals are , , , , and . However, when ligands with negative charge

In the area of spectrochemistry there is a theory which states and defines the correlation
between the variables in how light absorbent an aqueous substance is. This theory is called
Beer’s law and states Beer’s law, also called Lambert-Beer law or Beer-Lambert law, in
spectroscopy, a relation concerning the absorption of radiant energy by an absorbing medium
(Britannica). The relationship is presented in the form of a mathematical equation with three
variables of which two are manipulatable. The equation is as follows:
A= ε
lc
In the equation ‘A’ represents the absorptivity of the aqueous medium that is being analysed,
‘ ’
ε
the molar attenuation coefficient, which is a more complicated way of explaining the general
absorptivity of the molecule of interest.
‘c’ and ‘l’ stand for the concentration of the solution and
6
the path length, which expresses the distance that the light has to travel through the medium .
These are the two variables that can be manipulated to get a different value of ‘A’ depending on
the setup of the experiment and the resources used. Absorptivity is measured using the range
of values from 0-3 representing a percentage of the light absorbed. When a spectrometer
places the value of ‘A’ at 0 it means that 0% of the light was absorbed, 1 means that 1% was
absorbed, 2, 10%, and finally 3 showing that 100% of the light was absorbed.

A spectrophotometer is a machine that is used to analyse aqueous solutions to determine the
absorptivity of the solution ranging through the infrared-ultraviolet electromagnetic wavelengths.
It does this by shining a light containing all of the wavelengths of light in the given range through
a container of specific length containing an aqueous chemical solution. Once the light has
traveled through the container it reaches the sensor on the other side seensing how much of
each wavelength of light made it through.
In basic spectrochemistry there is a diagram that is often used in order to easily identify what
color of light is absorbed and then inversely emitted. The diagram consists of a color wheel
Research question:
What is the effect on light absorbance of a spectrophotometric analysis when changing the
concentration and ligand of different aqueous solutions forming complex ion structures?
The beer-lambert law is the most suitable theory for determining the correlation between the
concentration and the absorbance as it incorporates both of the variables. By decreasing the
concentration of the reagents that will be reacting with the hydrated copper (II) sulfate a
correlation can be determined between the concentration and the absorbance. As the value of
the molar attenuation coefficient should stay constant for each of the copper complexes formed,
it can be used to determine the reliability of the absorbance measurement. The equation that
accompanies the beer-lambert law is what incorporates the variable that will be changed and
analysed:
A= ε
cl
The crystal field theory equation used to determine the energy needed in order to promote an
electron to the higher energy d-orbital will also be analysed in order to find a correlation
between the ligand used and the color of light absorbed. Doing this will test to see if there is a
6
correlation between the strength of the ligands used to replace the water ligand of hydrated
copper (II) sulfate. This will also determine the validity of the spectrochemical series in the
energy difference between the ligands.
Though ultimately, the results of this experiment will investigate the usage of the beer-lambert
law equation in accurately being able to determine variables in its equation such as the molar
attenuation coefficient in laboratory environments. Since copper complexes already exist in bio
organisms and are essential in electron transfer processes, it has been found that they are
suitable for certain types of photovoltaic systems. These photovoltaic cells named “solid-state
perovskite solar cells” are solar cells made using copper complexes and have been recorded at
7
having an efficiency of 18.5%, getting close to the efficiency of standard solar cells . Being able
to accurately calculate the absorptivity will be essential in choosing chemical complexes that will
be good candidates in testing for optimal photovoltaic cells, which might later replace the
common solar panels.
Variables:
Independent variable:
Throughout the experiment two things will be changed, the ligand replacing the water molecules
and the concentration of the reagents that will be reacting with the hydrated copper (II) sulfate.
In part 1 of the experiment the ligands will be changed, in part 2 the concentration of the same
reactions in part 1 will be changed.
7 “Cu(II) Complexes as PType Dopants in Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells.” doi:10.1021/acsenergylett.6b00691.s001.

Dependant variable:
Three things will be measured in the experiment, the absorbance, time and peak wavelength.
The absorbance and peak wavelength will be measured in part 1 of this experiment and
absorbance along with time will be measured in part 2.
Controlled variable:
The most important things that will be controlled during this experiment will be the amount of
copper solution used in the reaction, the path length of the cuvette, and the final volume of the
reacted solution. Since the experiment is about finding how the ligands solution affects the
copper complex ion, it needs to be kept the same in order for feasible data analysis to be done.
The final volume of the reacted solution has to be kept constant, changing the final volume of
the reacted solution will change the concentration and distort the data.

Discussion and evaluation
Discussion of data and results
Part 1
During the first part of the experiment some of the more clear things noticed was the difference
in the absorbance graph that was shown for the different colored solutions. Since these tests
were done in order to determine both what wavelengths of light waves absorbed and which
wavelength had the highest absorbance, a lot of analysis can be made for the different
solutions. During the spectroscopic analysis when exchanging the H 2 O ligands on the hydrated
copper (II) sulfate with chlorine ions from HCl (hydrochloric acid) the predicted change was that
the solution would turn turquoise. After the reaction had undergone there was no change in
color when analysing the solution by eye and similarly when the solution was placed in the
spectrometer. The only difference observed between the hydrated copper (II) sulfate and the
reacted copper chloride complex was that the level of absorbance in the reacted copper chloride
was slightly higher than that of the diluted hydrated copper (II) sulfate solution. When adding
ammonia solution to the diluted hydrated copper (II) sulfate solution it turns a deep blue color as
the ammonia molecules replace the water as ligands. During the reaction between hydrated
13
copper (II) sulfate and potassium thiocyanate the solution goes from light blue to lime green,
later developing an opaque precipitate. A few hours later turning the opaque green solution into
a clear solution with a white precipitate. During the final reaction between hydrated copper (II)
sulfate and sodium hydroxide. This reaction is much faster than the potassium thiocyanate
reaction yielding a similar result where the solution turns cloudy leaving a blue precipitate in a
clear solution.
There were some interesting observations made when analyzing the reactions of the lower
concentration solution of the independent variable reagents. Though there was a general trend
where the product solution turned lighter in saturation, there was a different trend with the
addition of lower concentration of sodium hydroxide and ammonia solution. Instead of the
reaction producing less precipitate or the same with less opacity, the product of the sodium
hydroxide reaction became more gelatinous and firm with roughly the same if not a darker color.
The reason behind this is due to Copper (II) hydroxide being slightly amphoteric thus being
soluble in an excess solution of concentrated sodium hydroxide solution, creating tetrahydroxy
2− 8
cuprate ( [ 4
Cu(OH) ]
) . Since the reagents that reacted with the hydrated copper sulfate
ranged from 1M, 0.5M, 0.2M, and 0.1M, it wasn't until the sodium hydroxide was at 0.1M where
the desired reaction took place (when considering volume of reagents used in the reaction). The
second solution that had an interesting product when reacted at a lower concentration was the
ammonia solution. Instead of this reaction creating a dark blue solution with no precipitate as it
normally does, a clear solution was produced with a light-blue precipitate. This reaction is very
similar to the low concentration sodium hydroxide reaction due to the stages that take place

before creating the tetraammine copper (II) sulfate. Since the reaction of copper (II) sulfate and
ammonia solution normally occurs with an excess in ammonia the reaction process looks as
follows:
2−
−
[ 2 6
Cu(H O) ] N H Cu(H O) (OH) ] N H
+ 2 3 → [ 2 4 2 + 2 4
2+
Cu(H O) (OH) ] N H [ 2 4 2 + 2 3 → [ 3 4 2 2
Cu(N H ) (H O) ]
However, if not enough ammonia is present in order to carry this process out fully it will stop half
way, resulting in the product of the reaction being identical to the reaction between copper
sulfate and sodium hydroxide, with one difference. Since there are no hydroxide ions present in
the product solution such as in a sodium hydroxide solution, no tetrahydroxy cuprate will be
produced, creating a pure copper (II) hydroxide precipitate.
Quantitative:
Part 1
Analysing the original hydrated copper (II) sulfate solution an observation can be made that the
peak wavelength of absorption lays at 786nm meaning that it is in the infrared region. However,
the absorption of light in the other wavelengths that are above half of the peak absorption range
from 670nm to 950nm, meaning that it absorbs a lot of the light past infrared but also much red
light. Using the value for the maximum absorption a calculation can be made finding the molar
attenuation coefficient. Writing out the equation used in order to get this value,
0 = ε × 1 × 0

(keep in mind that for the CuSCN the measurement was stopped as soon as the initial reaction
was complete)
Another thing that we are able to get from the spectroscopic analysis is the energy needed for
an electron in the d-orbital split to be promoted and which complex compounds have a larger
split in the orbital. In order to calculate the energy difference between the two electron orbital
levels you need to calculate the energy of the photon equivalent to the wavelength of highest
absorption. Using the crystal field theory to calculate the value of Δo Δo

we can find the energy of the photon needed to promote the electron in the coordination

Bringing back the spectrochemical series mentioned in the background information, most of the
values here hold true to the order of energy difference between them. Since the repulsion of
ammonia has a much greater effect on the d-orbital than chlorine, thiocyanate and water, the
split in the d-orbital is greater and therefore requires more energy to promote an electron. The
trend continues as the values of the energy needed to promote an electron increase for
chlorine, water and thiocyanate in the order that is expected from the spectrochemical series.
However, the value for sodium hydroxide does not match the hypothesised energy needed in
order to promote an electron according to the calculations. The reason behind this is because
there was an oversight when
17
Part 2
During the measurements regarding the absorbance over time (change in absorbance) the
effect of changing the concentration does what would be expected for most of the solutions,
however has some interesting effect on some of them.
When measuring the absorbance over time for different concentration for a solution such as
[ 3 4 2 2
Cu(N H ) (H O) ]
, there is a strong linear trend showing that as the concentration of the
ammonia solution increases the absorbance increases by a linear amount. There are some
uneven changes in the absorptivity when changing the concentration, however, not big enough
to cause any anomalous data.
One of the tests that yielded unexpected results was the reaction between the hydrated copper
(II) sulfate and the hydrochloric acid. During these tests the absorption was the highest when
reacting with 1M HCl, however the absorption was higher when having reacted with the 0.2M
than with the 0.5M. The R 2 for the trend line suggest there is some anomalous data, which can
be seen by eye.
A linear line of best fit is the optimal trend line for due to the beer-lambert law equation being a
single variable equation where the concentration is the only factor that affects the absorbance.
The results gathered from the reaction creating [Cu(H 2 O) 4 (OH) 2 ] was expected to happen as it
was stated in the part 1 analysis that the reaction creates a precipitate that will only dissolve if
there is an excess amount of hydroxide ions. Though the trend line is one of the best out of the
18
graphs, due to there being a precipitate the beer-lambert law does not apply as it only works
fully with solutions void of precipitate.
The reaction between the potassium thiocyanate and hydrated copper (II) sulfate is the most
puzzling, as the best regression line is logarithmic with a R 2 value of 0.996. The best
explanation for this occurrence is that since it is very close to water in the spectrochemical
series a large change can be seen with a relative low equilibrium difference between the two
ligands.

Through this process a conclusion can be made that the data collected has a high degree of
systematic error such that there is a systematic error when recording the [Cu(NH 3 ) 4 (H 2 O) 2 ]
since the theoretical yield was greater than the starting amount. As well as the data points
located on the graph of absorbance over concentration not following clear and reasonable
patterns.
Evaluation of methodology:
One of the major strengths with the methodological process in this experiment was that all of the
processes were very controlled and carefully made sure to not have any uncertainty or error.
However, having a process be very carefully put together and structured made collecting data
take a lot of time. Data collection started before the summer break and was only able to gather
the minimum amount of data needed in order to analyse and discuss it to a feasible degree a
few days before the final draft was due. Furthermore, systematic errors occurred regardless of
the precautions taken as can be seen by some of the data and the correlation it bears due to the
time span in between the allocated time which data collection was possible. This means that
coming to a conclusion based on the data available is more difficult and some extrapolation and
interpretation had to be made in order to cover for the errors. Decreasing the level of control in
the lab would speed up the process, decreasing the number of systematic errors that would
occur due to inexperience and memory loss of the procedure as a result of weeks or months
passing by.
20
Conclusion:
When changing the ligands that are attached to a central metal ion, the greater the energy
difference they produce on the d-orbital the more energy an incoming light wave must have in
order to promote the electron to the upper d-orbitals. As the concentration of aqueous solution
of complex ion structures increases, the greater the absorbance of incoming light waves. The
degree to which this happens however is dependent on the molar attenuation coefficient as a
standard higher coefficient will have a higher effect on an concentration.

How will the experiment change
The concentration of the complex ion solution will be decreased by
approximately half each time going from 1M, 0.5M, 0.2M, 0.1M, apart from
KSCN which will have those concentrations divided by 10. The solutions will be

solution diluted using distilled water.
Reagent used
Different reagents will be reacted with the copper sulfate solution in order to
view the difference in change between a substitution in ligands. The different
reagents will be hydrochloric acid, ammonia in solution, potassium
thiocyanate

How will the experiment be measured
A spectrometer will measure how much light of a certain wavelength a solution
absorbs by shining a multichromatic light through
During the process of measuring absorbance for a certain wavelength the time
will also be measured in order to get a change in absorbance over time reading
Measuring and analysing the peak wavelength will show what wavelength and
color of light the complex compound absorbs and inversely emits.

How will the experiment be controlled
When preparing the reaction in part 1 the ratio between the reactants have to be
precise as there are certain complex structures that will undergo a reverse
reaction if there are excess of the ligand that is trying to be removed/substituted.
Therefore, the stoichiometric coefficient needs to be found of the reactants so
the proper amount of each can be found
Since Beer’s law uses the path length in the equation to find the absorbance, in
order to not overcomplicate things keeping the path length the same using the
same model of spectrometer is the easiest
In part 2 of the experiment the reactions will have to be done in the cuvettes in
order to be able to analyse the solutions completely from start until the desired
end. So creating a reaction ratio between volume of hydrated copper (II) sulfate
and the volume of a certain concentration of reagent is needed. Since the
cuvette has an approximate volume of 3cm 3
, 1ml of the hydrated copper (II)
sulfate solution will be reacted with 2ml of the reagent.

Detailed method appendix:
Part 1
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Connect a PASCO spectrometer to a computer that has the PASCO spectrometry
application installed.
Opening the application calibrate the spectrometer by filling a cuvette with distilled water,
placing it in the cuvette and pressing the light calibration and dark calibration.
Make sure that the measurement that is going to be taken is a graph of absorbance over
wavelength, giving you a description of the light absorbed by the solution in the different
wavelengths.
Take one beaker and fill it up with an excess amount of 1mol/dm CuSO 4 and using a
pipette, pour 1ml of the solution in a different beaker followed with 9ml of water in order
to create a 0.1mol/dm solution.
Take another beaker and fill it up with an excess amount of one of the reagents
(hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, potassium thiocyanate and ammonium hydroxide).
Pouring 1ml of the reagent into a measuring cylinder dilute with distilled water in order to
create a 0.5M solution of the reagent (HCl: 1HCl:3H 2 O, NaOH: 1NaOH:1H 2 O, NH 4 OH:
1NH 4 OH:1.5H 2 O, KSCN should not be diluted).
25
7. 8. 9. Using a pipette, pour 1ml 0.1M CuSO 4 into a cuvette and add 2ml of the 0.5M reagent
solution to let the reaction occur.
Once the reaction has stopped and there is no more visual change in the solution, place
it into the spectrometer and press the record button twice with an interval of about 5
seconds. Doing this makes sure that the measurement that it taken is stopped and
recorded but also that the chance of getting a faulty reading is decreased.
Don’t forget to label the runs so that you know what graph is representative of what
reaction, it will become important in part 2.
10. Repeat steps 5-8 and change the reagents used in the reaction between the ones listed
above to gain multiple different tests on different complex solutions.
Part 2
11. After repeating steps 5-8 until a measurement of all the samples has been made, select
a point on the graph with the coordinate tool which has the highest absorbance and
select it with the tick mark.
12. Repeat step 10 for each of the solutions recorded in part one.
13. Now in the spectroscopy application click on the graph labeled time in the top left, this
will now present a graph showing the absorbance of a certain wavelength over time.
14. On the page with the graph absorbance over time an option to choose active solution is
located to the right of the record button.
15. Set the sample rate to 5 Hertz
16. Having labeled the runs, choose the reaction that you did previously so that you can
measure the speed of the reaction in terms of the absorbance of its peak wavelength
over the recording period of time.
26
17. Now repeat steps 5-8 changing the concentration of the reagent solutions (1M, 0.5M,
0.2M, 0.1M)
